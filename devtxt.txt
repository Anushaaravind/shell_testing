DevOps is a set of software development practices that combine software development (Dev) and information-technology operations 
(Ops) to shorten the systems-development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment
 with business objectives.
 Toolchains
 As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those that practice the methodology use different sets of tools—referred to as "toolchains"—rather than a single one.[18] These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process:[19][unreliable source?][20][unreliable source?]

Coding – code development and review, source code management tools, code merging
Building – continuous integration tools, build status
Testing – continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks
Packaging – artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
Releasing – change management, release approvals, release automation
Configuring – infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools
Monitoring – applications performance monitoring, end-user experience.
